# *GeograPH*

# Main Premise:
 A geography quiz app of the philippine regions with three main modes
1) A quick flashcard mode, with a timer and scored kung gaano karami ang nahulaan
   - Guess the region of the city/province, or vice versa
2) An enumeration mode na list all provinces and place them in the correct area
   - If possible apply drag and drop mechanic
3) Geographical location where pipindutin yung mismong location based sa graphic na binigay
   - like region 1, then pipindutin dapat ang area na yun

# Main Parts
1) Main menu and the parent node as viewport
2) 3 modes with a scene for each
3) graphics of the map and general look
4) music....
 
- Sa flashcard mode ay pwedeng kunin mula sa portal project
- yung enumeration mode is still wip kung paano maimplement

## Mode 3
*Node Tree*

2d Scene 
- TileMap or smth
- Touch zone (2d node)
	- touchArea nodes
